# Creative Media

The Creative Media team are the ones looking to create
- Orientation Theme + Lore
- Props/Mascots
- Orientation publicity
- Orientation merch designs (e.g. shirt, tote bag)
- Photography/Videography
- Centerpiece!

Although technically non-essential in that without all of CM, Orientation will still occur, the importance of the aesthetic and *vibes* should not be understated. 

Good design and aesthetic choices make the whole Orientation feel more complete and memorable. 

{: .note}
> Typically, OComm would begin by setting a theme and building from there. However, with RC things in the mix uhhhhhh thats tuff.

there is more to write but i am lazy rn.

## Photography/Videography
CM works with the relevant fifth rows in arranging for support in theses aspects. 
- Photography - SUTD PhotogCircle
- Videography - SUTD Productions

## Centerpiece

The centerpiece is one of the more *unique* components of SUTD's orientation. The motivation is to show off a part of SUTD's maker culture, and to feature in the closing ceremony as a part of the storyline or lore.

The "tradition" only started in 2023 when then PD (Yirong) and his friends created it for the lols in 1 month.
