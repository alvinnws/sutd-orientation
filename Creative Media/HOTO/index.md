## Executive Summary 

The orientation was successful in its thematic execution and creative output. Having a predefined theme significantly accelerated the early stages of planning. However, improvements are required in communication responsiveness, departmental workload distribution, and procurement timelines. 

## Key Successes (What Went Well) 

**Early Thematic Vision:** Establishing the theme before the official start streamlined all subsequent design and narrative decisions.  
**Creative Freedom:** Allowing actors and skit participants the freedom to mold their characters resulted in higher engagement and better performances.  
**Production Quality:** Lighting and stage directions were noted as high quality.  
**Resourcefulness:** The centerpiece team effectively managed budget constraints by using cardboard, resulting in a decent final product despite high costs for other materials.  
**Media Assets:** The overall branding (Logo, Names, House identities) provided a strong foundation for the event's visual identity. 

## Departmental Analysis & Lessons Learned 

### Creative & Branding 

**Identity:** Logo, Orientation Name, and House Names must be the first items designed.  
**Collaboration:** The entire graphics team should contribute to the initial branding phase to ensure consistency.  
**Tools:** A shared **Canva Pro** account should be established immediately for universal access to assets. 

### Skits & Performances 

**Role Clarity:** Clear Job Descriptions (JDs) are required for mascots (e.g., Daniel’s experience). Mascots should be encouraged to interact more with freshies (cheers, dances, improv to fill time).  
**Rehearsals:** Practices consistently take longer than scheduled; buffers must be added to the timeline. We took almost 4-5 hours for 20 min worth of script due to the lighting set up and general blocking.  
**Backstage Essentials:** Must always stock **Pipagao** for voices and have torchlights available for stagehands.  
**Stage Management:** A dedicated Stage Director is essential to prevent the General Director from being overextended. 

### Scripting & Media Production 

**Scripting Accountability:** The process suffered from unresponsive members. Future teams should appoint **one single Point of Contact (POC)** for scripts to liaise with the Productions team.  
**Productions Integration:** The Productions team must be involved the moment scriptwriting begins.  
**Trailer:** Final trailers **must include subtitles**. VFX needs at least two dedicated members who are present during the trailer shoot.  
**Photography:** Contact photographers at least **5 months in advance** to mitigate scheduling issues.  
**Bands:** All communication with bands must be **official**; avoid asking for personal favors. Engage them early to coordinate AV requirements. 

### Merchandise & Procurement 

**Workflow:** Assign **one person per item** (e.g., one for shirts, one for tote bags) to avoid redundant design efforts. 
**Timeline:** Design must be finished by **Term 2**. Procurement must be finalized before the **GEO**. 
**Shirt Design:** Use house colors prominently on the front of shirts for easy identification. Poll OGLs on designs early to speed up the selection process. 
**Finance:** Work closely with Fundraising and Finance. Send sponsor decks immediately after receiving quotations. 

### Publicity & Outreach 

**Team Size:** Minimum of **3 people** required.  
**Content Strategy:** Plan Instagram posts in batches. Implement a "What’s in my bag" post to explain merchandise (e.g., clarifying that tattoos are temporary).  
**Approvals:** A more efficient system for post-approvals is needed to avoid bottlenecks. 

### Costumes & Centerpiece (The "Makers" Team) 

**Resource Management:** Access to the **Makespace/FabLab** should be requested 4 months in advance. 
**Safety & Equipment:** Budget for **respirators** when dealing with toxic chemicals. Invest more in quality tools and buy spare materials upfront ("Spend first, think later"). 
Workload: These tasks are exhausting during Term 3. Start earlier and implement "soft deadlines" to ensure the final deadline is met. 
**Manpower: * Costumes:** ideally 1 person per costume, or 2 ppl every 3 costumes, budget probably 70-80 per costume 
**Centerpiece:** Requires more discussion between sub-teams and a "Mini-boss" who is more "nosy" regarding deadlines and workspace organization. 

 

## Management & Leadership Recommendations 

### Structural Changes 

**Division of Labor:** Directors should explicitly split the committee into **Makers** (Costume, Centerpiece) and **Media** (Logo, Storyline, Merch, Publicity, Trailers). 
**Meeting Cadence:** Every sub-committee must have at least one internal meeting within the first month of formation. 
**Accountability:** Directors must remain highly contactable. Assign a specific person to conduct "progress checks" on deliverables. 

### Skills & Training 

**Workshops:** Conduct CM (Construction/Maker) workshops with seniors. 
**Technical Literacy:** Force more members to undergo training for the Zünd cutter, sewing machines, and woodworking. Build a rapport with FabLab staff for technical assistance. 

### Operational Tips 

**Hostel Living:** It is significantly easier for Directors to manage the project if they stay in the hostel during Term 3. 
**Administrative Hurdles:** Establish a group chat with relevant staff (e.g., Charlene) early for weapon approvals and safety clearances. 
**Budgeting:** Funds often become available toward the end of the project; plan contingency spending in advance.
