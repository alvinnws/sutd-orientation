# Fundraising

The goal of the Fundraising is self-explanatory. More money, more better. More free gifts, more better.

The Fundraising director achieves this by creating a sponsorship deck and directly reaching out to various companies. 

Typically, there would be two types of sponsorships -- Cash, and Product In-Kind

**Cash sponsorships** mean that the company ONLY gives cash to Orientation, supplementing our budget and allowing us to spend in any manner we would like. We didn't get any in 2025 :(

**Product In-Kind sponsorships** are where the companies arrange for us to receive their products, and we can distribute to freshies. Some examples are the Pokka bottled drinks during wet games, the screwdriver kits from Polymate, the tote bags from KWOH, and the various vouchers you received in the ori goodie bags!

However, the companies would expect something in return, in order to increase their brand exposure. This can come in the form of
- IG posts or challenges
- Verbal acknowledgement
- Logo on Orientation merchandise
- Product feature in one or more games
- Anything you can create to sound attractive!
