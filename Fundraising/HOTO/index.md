## Choosing of Subcomm: 
### 3 Subcomm roles: 
- Sponsor Scout: Reviewing and searching for sponsor companies (make the sponsor list excel) 
  - Choose a person who knows companies and how to search for them. 
- Negotiator: Brainstorm the benefit tier and make the sponsorship slides.  
  - Honestly, this can be anyone. Someone who u can discuss with and can help with slides + good communication to liaise with companies 
- Email IC: Make the email templates and help with the email merge 
  - Choose someone who have experience in reaching out with companies through emails. 
- Comment: I think these roles are okay and it works, can implement for next year 

No need to have many members, I think can do w 3 members ( so 1 person each role). Just choose people who can help and know the basics beforehand, so they are not confused on where to start.  
Try to find people who can double job ( cos fundraising comm doesn’t have anything to do during ori and like compared to other subcomm, not much job to do for the members also, honestly I feel like director can tank tasks after submitting the files needed for OSL approval)  
 
## Sponsor List: 
- Can focus on SMEs instead of big MNCs. Easier to land, but most probably product in-kind. So can still include big companies but I’d say set no expectations w it.  
- Importantly, choose companies that can help with freshies journey in SUTD, e.g. makers  (other than companies that provide cash ofc) 
- We split the excel sheets based on categories (see file). Easier to find companies and tidier. And we split the emails based on categories also, so easier to do the mail merge. 
- Don’t try reach out to govt companies next year  
- Reach out to SUTD startups again, can ask OSL if we can ask DIVE to help reach out to the startups 
 
## Benefit Tier & Slides: 
- Figure out what thing u want to focus (cash or product) 
- Delete benefits that incorporate games since progs need to get the proposal out before the sponsor confirmation 
- We split the benefit tier to based on cash or product-in-kind (cos cash is more valuable, hence more exclusive benefits than product-in-kind). However, we ran into a problem where a company wanted to take some benefits from cash tier, however, they can’t give the value tier we had set. For our year, we rejected their idea cos it's nearly ori and I have made agreement with some sponsors. For next year, can consider another one which is hybrid (probably Crystal will say something about this on OPW, if not, go ask her ) 
- Can explore new benefit for the companies but its school is very limiting on what we can do, so if theres none that u can add also ok. If u want to add publicity benefits that need CM team to do, please tell them beforehand. 
- Slides can see file. Try to keep the structure, most impt thing is the benefits!! 
 
## Email Template: 
- We split based on categories of the companies. Can do again to make it seem more specialised 
- Learn mail merge pls!!!! And plspls ask office for the ori marketing email password instead of them giving access. Cos to do mail merge you need the old ver of outlook which u can only login to the acc if u have the password (technically u can login, but the outlook email will bug A LOT and waste sm time) 
 
## Others:
- Do start very early, ideate new things that u can think off, iron some concerns with Crystal (ask advices from her also), and follow the timeline deadline. Can chase OSL to fast approve, so can start earlier.  
Then u replyreply, negonego. Some of them will have some confliction about things, u can go call with them (faster, and some don’t really read ur email reply LOL). Most of them will respond faster through chat, so can write ur phone number on ur signoff email, just in case. And when u get their contact and want to ask something short and QUICK, can chat I guess.  
- When receiving the sponsor benefits, can give a token of appreciation to the sponsors (errr not sure, can ask advice from crystal) 
- If not sure of something, can always email/ask Crystal about it. Don’t go say something that ure not sure about to the company 
- For IG Challenge, sponsors do caption (tasks) and CM team will do the post. Constantly remind sponsors if they nvr send 
- Manage ur prizes, if u seem that u need more lucky draw prizes, liase w the companies to change. 
- Reach out to polymate again and contact KWOH to be our shirts + totebags vendor/sponsor (they sponsor out totebags and they overall are very nice!!!) 
- Pls consult OSL first about a sponsor proposal if its questionable, especially from big companies (cos stricter) 
- Have hard deadline for sponsor confirmations ( for my year, Crystal out 2 months before ori, can try to nego about this? Try to extend a bit for products) 
- Please clearly say to subcomm that EVERYONE must be present during ori day!! Please remind them multiple times also! 
- For vendors, don’t approach them directly whether they want to sponsor or not. Can approach them by saying that we’re interested in buying, do u want to sponsor mybe? à So they’re more interested 
- Keep sponsor products in one corner of OHQ, check everything before lucky draw.
