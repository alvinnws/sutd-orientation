# Logistics
Logistics sounds easy compared to the others on paper, just move things from A to B. However, supporting an event as big as Orientation creates more complications when parts are constantly moving.

A good logistics committee should not be noticed. When you get there, the stations/needed materials are all there. When you leave, the area is cleaned and kept to how it was prior to our use and the next party to use doesn't notice anything is off.

The logistics director is also in charge of our Orientation Headquarters (OHQ). This serves as a base for us to keep all our items, from logs to sponsorship gifts and whatever else the committee purchases. One main complication would be that as the space is used, it gets less and less tidy and things are harder and harder to find.

> On day 3, our comm initially could not find a couple hundred dollars worth of lucky draw prizes after more than 30mins of searching. OHQ was a mess after the entirety of ori, but we found it in the end so all is good.

As a note to all the other directors, please show your logs comm the appreciation they deserve.
