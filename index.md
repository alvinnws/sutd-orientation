Hello! This site was created to act as a permanent space for information pertaining to the planning and execution of SUTD's Freshmen Orientation. 

The information contained within has been written by the committee for 2025's Orientation.  

While most of the event planning and execution can be thought similar to events held in other universities or other general events, there are some components that are unique to the workflow of SUTD (e.g. Centerpiece, finance processes, other administrative details).

As an overview, here are the rough timelines for our batch (and earlier), and as a result of the mess that is SUTD's academic calendar, your batch
