## What does the PD do?
It's a serious question. The PD doesn't write/submit proposals, the PD doesn't interview OGLs[^1], the PD doesn't source for vendors, the PD doesn't setup/teardown stations, the PD doesn't carry logs.  

So what does the PD really do?

From my point of view, the important things the PD must do are to:
- Understand the entirety of Orientation,
- Maintain the direction of each subcomm,
- Care for the welfare of your committee,
- Create space for your subcomm to work efficiently,
- Make big decisions during the event, and if shit goes wrong,
- Take the blame.

Ok actually, the PD also has some GOH/VIP related things, but like I'll elaborate later dwdw

You'll notice that these are all soft targets, unlike other directors. In planning ori, PD acts more like middle management, with KPI/targets from upper management(OSL), and employees who carry out the grunt work(subcomm). I say act, and not is, because at the end of the day your other comm directors are your peers, and you are one committee as a whole. DO NOT POWER TRIP.

## Understand the entirety of Orientation
What this looks like depends on the phase in planning you're at, but they generally have these outcomes
- When asked, you can give a summary of what is happening/what will be happening
- When asked more, you can describe the current activity
- When asked even more, you can find the full details within 2 minutes on your phone

> As the PD, you are expected to have full knowledge of the operation at all times. If you cannot answer a question, you are not doing your job right.

During planning, it can look like
- Knowing what deadlines are upcoming
- Knowing what each subcomm is working on
- Knowing when you can expect the tasks to be completed
- Knowing where the relevant documents are located
- NOT knowing the exact status of each subcomm member
- NOT knowing the exact daily update of each document

During events (dry run/refresher/ori), it can look like
- Knowing the full programme flow for the day
- Knowing the description of all activities for each day
- Knowing any cutoff timings
- Knowing what tasks need to be done
- Knowing where to find the document describing all current rotations/positions of OGs
- Knowing where key personnel (i.e. directors, safety) are
- NOT knowing the exact position of each OG
- NOT knowing the exact positions of each subcomm member

Does this mean I knew all of that during your Orientation? Not always, maybe 90%. I wasn't perfect, you might not be, but we still aim to be.

To know all of this falls only onto the PD. Logs does not need to know what IG posts are being made, CM doesn't need to know what games are being played, Fundraising doesn't need to know what lore is being created. But the PD does.

## Maintain the direction of each subcomm
another day problem

## Care for the welfare of your committee
just dont let them feel alone or that theyre drowning, help them if u can else treat them well

## Create space for your subcomm to work efficiently
another day problem

## Make big decisions
Your committee must come to the mutual understanding that, at the end of the day, the PD has the final say. This can mean rejecting idea $x$, or forcing idea $y$. That being said, this must also be distinct from power tripping. You are not making *your* dream come to life, you act in the best interests of *Orientation*. 

> For example, someone's response to wanting to be part of Orientation is that they "like to touch kids". Of course, you know this is a joke, they know its a joke, they have people who can vouch for them and say they are a good person. You must still tell your directors that this person cannot be taken in. The interests of the programme are above your own.

During the events, you also hold extra responsibility in any ad hoc decisions. If things change, activities are delayed, weather becomes bad, games cause injuries, you choose what to do next. Yes, any of your directors can have opinions, they should, and you should accept their views, but you make the choice.

Consider the following scenario:
- It is lightly drizzling, the sky is a very light grey and there is no lightning alert, even in surrounding regions
- The OGMs are playing wet games outdoors and wow very fun!
- The field must be cleaned before it is used by external parties that evening
- No one is allowed out during lightning alert, even without rain, even to clean up
- OSL has expressed their concern about the weather
- Your welfare director is running around with his safety ICs dealing with injuries
- Your progs director is burnt out and mentally recovering in a safe space
- Your logs director is busy maintaining the current activities

What do you do? Do you let the OGms continue in the spirit of Ori? Do you call them in and let cleanup take place? This literally happened during your Orientation, and it was my (the PD's) responsibility to decide and then TELL OSL that we will keep the games running.

## Take the blame
This one is very simple. If OComm fucked up, you fucked up. Don't say your director did it, just own up say, "sorry this was my fault, I should have done $x$ when I noticed $y$." (@other directors this applies to your subcomm too)

Sometimes this can also mean accepting the blame even when you didn't know it happened. You lost an overview of the operation, it is still on you.

This does **not** mean you CAN make dumb decisions and just accept blame. The bigger your mistake the bigger you will get fucked by whichever office feels like. Make smart decisions, but understand that everything has risk, be able to explain your rationale and accept responsibility when things break.
