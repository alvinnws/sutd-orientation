# Welfare
The welfare director is in charge of quite a variety of tasks, namely
- House heads, OGLS and generally keeping track of OGMs
- Safety, including first aid, ambulance and (if needed) fire watch
- Food - sourcing for vendors and catering

As a result of all that, the welfare director receives the biggest cut of Orientation's budget. However, this also means they have to deal with even more PAFs than anyone else.

## Safety
### First Aid Course
Orientation will have 10 people to be sent for first aid training. Typically we send the following (in order of importance):
- Welfare Director
- Safety ICs
- House Heads
- Project Directors

However, you must still make a balance of male and female first-aid trained personnel.

(also neither of our project directors went for the training yay?)

### Fire related
In the use of the smoke machine for closing ceremony/finale night, the normal fire alarms **must** be deactivated (or else they would be tripped). You would need to indicate someone to be on fire watch.

## Food
The minimum requirement is to serve bentos on all days, and dinner on day 3. Your batch had the extra luxury of packet drinks for every meal as well as bread for breakfast. 

If you liked it, hope your committee can find the budget for it again.
