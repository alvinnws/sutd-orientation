Unfortunately, due to changes in the academic calendar and in how ROOT recruited, this is the timeline you'll deal with. This means that, yes, you have less time to settle your shit.

You're not cooked. The worst case is you literally copy-paste the previous Ori plan. There is always a fallback plan. Ideally, you get to improve on weak points that your cohort did not enjoy, but its okay.
