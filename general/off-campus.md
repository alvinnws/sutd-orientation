One of the best ways to make orientation feel more atas is to take the freshies outside of school! This is where I tell you about all the potential problems and you'll have to decide if it is worth the trouble.

## Requirements
This is one of the areas where SUTD differs to other schools by a large margin.
- Transport must be provided to-and-fro
- Venue must be officially booked by SUTD

2 requirements only?? huat.

sike. ts sucks, you're telling me if we go to sentosa we can't dismiss them there and let them find their own dinner/chill longer if they want? yep. correct.

## Sentosa
You may have heard that 2023's Ori went to Sentosa, but 2024 and 2025 didn't. Why?

- You must get a quotation and officially book the venue. A beach in sentosa costs around 1.5k-2k SGD.
- Weather be hot (or rainy), you must provide shelter as appropriate, requiring the booking of tentages so people can rest under shelter. Another money sink.
- Transport must be provided! All 500+ freshies, all 100+ ogls, all subcomm members, all logistics. This also costs a very significant amount (3k-4k SGD).
- People need to eat! Fun fact, if you host an event at Sentosa, you are required to use *their* vendor for food related concerns. In 2023, they just had an early lunch before setting off, but it is still a concern.

All considered, this puts the cost estimate of a sentosa trip around 10k. 
I'm not saying you can't do it, but a lot of sacrifice and hopium must be made. 
In 2023, they had a sponsor drop 10k+SGD on OComm, 2024 and 2025 wasn't so lucky.

(worth noting, even if we had an extra 20k my comm was never plannning to go to sentosa)

## But other schools can do?
Yeah they have different admin requirements, thats tough.
