# Finance

{: .note}
The finance director comes from ROOT's finance department. If you're reading this with hopes that it could be you, no chance unfortunately.

The Finance director is the only director who has no subcommittee. This is mainly because only the director themself has access to approve/reject concur requests, and so any subcommittee member would be entirely useless.

The main task of finance is to create a rough plan for Orientation budget, allocate it to each committee, and later to deal with invoices + concur requests. As a result, the finance director *needs* to be meticulous and careful with each and every cent.
