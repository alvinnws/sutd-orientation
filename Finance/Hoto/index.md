## Introduction and Overview
To the person who will be taking over,  
Hii, I’m Imelda the finance director for Orientation’25.  
So a short intro of what you will need to do:  
- You will be handling all the finance stuff for orientation
- At the start after receiving the fund amount from OSL, you would need to allocate the budget according to the needs of each department (say welfare needs this amount for food, cm needs this amount for shirts) so your job is to consolidate all their budget requests and allocate accordingly, then start keeping track of the budget.
- Meanwhile you will be tracking and settling the (1) concur requests and (2) invoice
payments.
- Do update your budget plan frequently and share with your fellow ori directors about their budget and spending, to make sure they are within budget. Although finance is a behind the scenes kind of job, but you will still be very involved in the planning.  

Be adaptable, and enjoy the process!

(might change for your year but the events that will happen should be the same)

## Significant Areas/Events for the Department
Section | Description 
:-|:-
1: Budget Doc | Allocate the total sum for each departments needs, this is the doc that I worked on can refer if needed: [redacted for now?] <br><br>- each projected spending do not need to be too finalized, can change anytime tune here tune there as long as total is within budget <br> - it’s ok to just have estimate amount at first (but make sure the estimation make sense)<br> - start by listing what needs money and then only allocate budget based on that 
2: PAFs | All the PAFs that need to be submitted: <br> 1) Dry run food <br> 2) Ambulance <br> 3) T-shirts <br>  4) Meals for actual orientation (Lunch/dinner) <br>  5) Any miscellaneous buys from departments that is $300 and above <br> 6) COMPASS Licensing <br> <br> Remember to check if the supplier is registered on ARIBA, if no need to register them can refer to ori finance email we registered a few 
3: Concur | Yes so other than the ones go by invoice through the school’s ARIBA system, all the rest of the money will go through concur, so it’ll be student self pay first then get reimbursement from school <br><br> - update your transaction register + budget plan constantly <br>- find something that you’re comfortable with to keep track of all requests, claims, prfs and pafs (I used this google doc: [redacted for now?]) <br>- when approving claims check and make sure all details are right all necessary documents are submitted (to make sure they don’t come back to u hahahahahaha <br>- concur is not that deep just need time to slowly get used to it, approve more le jiu will be used to it (any ques just ask your sec, me or any finance peeps) 
4: Prize Acknowledgement Sheet | Not something really big, just remember this if y’all doing lucky draw or giving prizes (best og prize etc) 

And basically that’s it a pretty straightforward job, just need a little more patience and will be working with numbers!
## How you should choose your Subcommittee Members
Finance has no subcom, as you will be the only one having access and approving of all finances :D

## Managing Subcommittee Members/other student helpers (OGLs, GMs, other student helpers etc.)
Instead of this, lets talk about the people that you will be working with:
1) Logs Director: as he/she buys materials and items for the progs and games
2) CM Director: as he/she needs to purchase ori T-shirts and any merch
3) Welfare Director: as he/she need to settle the many welfare orders of food, ambulance, more food….
4) PD: When PAFs are more than $300 you will need them to sign tgt with you

## Collaboration with other Directors
Talk and communicate with all other directors and don’t be shy to chase after them to submit claims, requests, or query some purchases that you think may not be necessary and reason it out with them. (Of course, please hear them out too)  

Keep track of the timeline and to make sure you get the PAFs in time, you can set an internal dateline for the respective directors before sending PAFs that need OSL approval. 

## What can be explored in your year
To maybe have a short f2f briefing about the whole finance steps
- how to concur (request & claim)
- how to do invoice docs (paf prf quotation)  

And the must know stuff
- request must be made before buying stuff
- when claiming need proof of delivery + receipt etc

Then make sure everyone is clear to can make work easier as all of them might be procuring
