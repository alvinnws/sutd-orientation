## Key pitfalls
The biggest mistakes I made oops
- Hype: Ori is a longgggg commitment, for everyone involved but Ocomm especially. 
  - Don’t burn out
  - Please don’t burn out
  - You need to be present and energetic during Ori itself, I highkey died during actual Ori which resulted in less pleasant experiences for other people involved
  - Our Ocomm was entirely introverts (not by choice✊😔) and we all did not like public speaking but bopes ah Progs Welfare PDs have to speak in front of a big audience the most.
  - Try to have fun! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA it’s tough, but you also have a lot of power in Ori 😈 my best memories of Ori were either chilling or having a crisis w the rest of Ocomm 
- Communication
  - Oops I gatekept information that other comms needed! Logs, Welfare, Fundraising and PDs (in descending order) NEED to know what Progs is planning, it’s good for other comms to be updated as well but for things like minor changes to individual games (of which there are. many.) Logs especially needs to know - it’s tough to blindly prepare logs for games so if you’ve written up everything clearly + update regularly you’ll also make their job easier. Welfare needs to make sure their house heads + safety reps + whoever else knows what’s necessary to keep Ori running. Fundraising might need to know for sponsorships, and PDs should just generally have an idea of everything that’s happening.
  - Be clear on what you need your comm/other comms/GMs/OGLs to do, keep the relevant directors updated (when in doubt, cc the entirety of Ocomm in your emails)

## OGL Bonding Day
What I did: tried to get GMs and OGLs to play together but also tried to get the GMs to practice running games, was an overall mess. Also did not plan out manpower properly.  
IMO as the name suggests; for Progs the main objective of this day should be for bonding.  
What I should have done:  
- Programmes: progs can help run the games (can pull the rest of Ocomm to help as well; usually Finance/Fundraising/PDs don’t have much to do at this time)
- GMs: GMs might already know the OGLs, but bonding with the OGLs isn’t crucial. They’re going to work more closely with the other GMs, so they should play the games with each other (if you want to get them to play the games at all)
- OGLs: whatever this day is just for them to have fun. Check with Welfare if they want specific activities/games to help assess the OGLs.

## Dry Run
What I did: NOT plan out manpower/scheduling properly. This is where it would help to be a bit neurotic. Also it was chaos to cram 3 days of Ori into 2 days of Dry Run while still trying to keep to the actual schedule so people know what should be happening on d-day. Ideally you should already have 95% of the actual Ori planned out by the time you dry run, then dry run everything is settled and you’re only worrying about unforeseen issues/timing. BUT things happen 🤷
- OGLs: we had some complaints that things weren’t as planned out as they expected (🤬🤜😤) but you can only promise to do better 🤷 cannot undo what has been done (but you can learn from my mistakes)

## Refresher
I would recommend using this day to make it extremely clear to everyone involved in Ori where they should be at what time. We didn’t want to take more of everyone’s time so we tried to squeeze everything into 2 days but. Uty if you want to make it 3 full days of the whole actual schedule. If not by dry run, by refresher you should be very clear on the entire plan for Ori, so uty if you want to run through it with Everyone but I recommend running through your entire plan at least once with ocomm.

## D-day
I died

Idk if you noticed but my soul had flown out the window by the time Ori rolled around and I just wanted it to be Over. Luckily Progs comm, Ocomm, GMs and OGLs could mostly handle everything without me by that point so it was still ok 👍(if you have a good plan, everyone can just follow the plan and all you have to do is put out fires!) By Wet Games I completely checked out and poor guoyao (Welfare) had to handle everything with alvin (PD) but ideally Progs should be helping to oversee everything also… oops

## Misc.
- People **will** drop out — other commitments, not interested anymore, ~~not interested anymore but staying in the comm just not contributing…~~ this is Fine

- Ok but frfr manpower can always come from somewhere else (the ex-ROOT president showed up with some of his friends to be GM); remember that everyone involved is actually basically volunteering their time and effort in exchange for a fun/meaningful experience
- You can have fun too! Don’t stress things will always work out lol
- When you are confused GMs (and everyone else) are confused. Try not to be confused.
- Sometimes when there are disputes between people involved in Ori you may feel the urge to say it’s not that deep. Unfortunately, it is that deep to the people involved and you need them to be happy so they will continue helping Ori. It is mostly Welfare’s job to make people happy but Progs is unfortunately also one of the more people-facing positions of Ori so you will have to help settle personal issues sometimes
- **It is that deep but it’s not that deep  **
