# Programmes

The big three responsibilities of programmes are
- Games/Activities for Day 1-3
- Closing Ceremony
- Finale Night

However, its typical to have secondary responsibilities that act as practice rounds
- OGL Bonding Day
- Dry Run
- Refresher Run
- Finale Dry Run

In planning these items, OComm is able to go through a combined EPF/RAF proposal rather than submitting separately as other events would have to.

## Finale Night
Many fifth rows collaborate with Orientation as performers, so it is important to reach out to them early! They need the advance notice to plan out their schedules/trainings and to arrange for performers.

Some of the common fifth rows we look for are
- Bands
- Scratch
- DDZ
- Funktion
