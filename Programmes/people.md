It’s tough but it’s rewarding and you can 100% do it

☆: esp for early stages

## Dealing with people
### Ocomm
The people you’ll be working with the most! Hopefully you all get along, any problems try to resolve ASAP or let your seniors know. TBH Progs works with basically everyone, there’s no comm you can avoid for the entirety of Ori.  
**Logistics**
- Jamie (logs director) helped me buy almost everything LOL; talk to your logs director and see what kind of arrangement y’all prefer
- Logs will help you book venues, and make sure you have all the materials you need for every game + finale night
- Keep Logs Director in the loop!!! Add them to whatever groupchats, cc them in emails etc. unless you want to keep having to repeat information and clear up confusion
- Logs comm also helps move whatever logistics you need to wherever you need it e..g for games, finale night etc. get GMs to help with it because Logs comm is usually overworked
- You can get logs to help make props if needed but tbh I should have just gotten progs to do it logs were doing a lot alr  
**Fundraising**
- 2025 we wanted to try incorporating sponsors into the games more than just getting prizes from them, if you want to do this go and bug fundraising early — for my year the fundraising deadlines were much later and it was difficult to keep changing games for sponsors so go and discuss with fundraising if this is something yall are interested in the discussion with companies needs to happen much earlier (or don’t let fundraising have it in their sponsorship benefits at all) ☆
- We had a goated Fundraising comm that got us hella prizes (esp for Finale) and helped us get some prizes reassigned to Closing (bc i forgot Closing needed prizes also oops)  
**Welfare**
- My year we split GMs under Programmes and OGLs under Welfare, I think this was okay but previous years put both under Welfare, uty (see ‘GMs’ below) ☆
- You + Welfare (+ maybe PDs) are mainly responsible for keeping the hype up; i think we could have done a better job of that… (see ‘Key pitfalls’ below)
- Other than you and maybe your PDs, Welfare should know the most about what’s happening in terms of activities and games; they can also help to be IC if you need one but you can’t be there for whatever reason; but during Ori itself Welfare will be one of the busiest directors (Usually, you and welfare (and logs) will be the most tired at the end of each day; but if you work Together neither of you needs to be Exhausted)  
**CM**
- I got CM to help with making some props, coordinating audio/lights for closing — this made sense because they were already liaising with people for av and the skits they wanted to do, see how with what your CM wants to do 
- I wanted CM’s help to make the activities fit the overall story better but they were busy and progs comm didn’t really know anything about the plot so in the end it didn’t happen🤷 lowkey I don’t think it matters though bc people still had fun
- I also wanted CM to help with finale night but uhhh bit tough to coordinate across comms yea
- In the end CM took over most of closing and progs comm handled finale which also made sense bc each comm just had to be in one location (mostly)  
**Finance**
- Since Logs did most of the purchasing for me I didn’t really have to do finance stuff myself haha other than COMPASS stuff
- Main thing is estimate how much budget you need; I let Logs use Progs budget since they were buying so much for us; can consider drafting your budget together w Logs
- Don’t be afraid to text your finance director to approve urgent claims; can also let them know in advance if you/your comm is making a claim (our finance director was solid💯responsive AND helpful 10/10)  
**PDs**
PDs should be keeping the team together, keeping track of deadlines, resolving disputes, helping out wherever help is needed, etc. If they’re NOT, let your secretary/seniors know ASAP
- For me PDs were most useful to help make announcements/briefings when I didn’t want to do public speaking HAHA also as a scapegoat when I want to do something OSL might not necessarily approve of
- Jk PDs can also help to oversee any happenings if you need to be elsewhere 
### Programmes comm
Tbh, 4-5 people for the planning stage is sufficient IF everyone is helping, even 2-3 REALLY efficient and solid comm members would be enough, but extra manpower is most appreciated on d-day (see “Commitment” below)  
**Division of labour**
- I didn’t really divide up the labour or make people’s roles clear enough (TBH i myself wasn’t so clear on why/how the previous comm split their roles that way) but here’s how I would do it if I had to do it again (feel free not to use):
- Games: Should be thinking about - is the game fun? Is it feasible? Does it include enough members of the group?
- Activities: does the activity/game fit with the overall theme/flow/purpose of Ori? What other activities can be incorporated into ori? Can consider liaising with CM/Fundraising
- Proposals: My proposals ICs were the people I trusted the most to be organised and get work done… Ideally you can trust all members of your comm to do that tho
- D-day ICs: upon reflection it would have made my life easier to have section ICs on the day itself e.g. when the activities were split between 2 ISHs, designating at least 1 IC per ISH to keep track of things/give game briefings, or having someone IC of the GMs would be easier (also because I was the only Progs IC, I was relying on Welfare and PDs to keep track of things also) can also consider designating ICs for each major event e.g. for my year maybe 1 for Scavenger Hunt, 1 for Wet Games, 1 for Finale Night etc.
- Can also consider splitting people by day, by major event etc.designating people to communicate with other comms e.g. Logs  
**Commitment**
- Out of all the subcomms, Programmes (both director(s) and subcomm) arguably has the most work. It is doable if everyone pulls their weight (and you need to assign work efficiently)
- I pulled a lot of people I already knew to be Programmes, but a surprising number of people were genuinely interested in the game planning aspect -> Quantity > Quality look for the people who will do work rather than taking on whoever b/c you’re desperate
- Caveat: Programmes comm will almost definitely have to double-up as GMs (unless miraculously a shit ton of ppl sign up to be GM), so extra manpower is nice there, but people can also be pulled from other comms/a few volunteers will want to join in later on/closer to Ori - but make this clear to Progs comm that they need to be there on actual day as well to be GMs
### GMs
You cannot run Ori without GMs. A good GM can make or break a game. Other than Progs comm (who mostly became GMs anyway) GMs are the best source of feedback on games.
- OGL Bonding Day: I wanted the GMs and the OGLs to play the games together to bond so hopefully they would work better together but it turned out kind of a mess (see “Key pitfalls: OGL Bonding Day” below) either have the GMs bond with each other or practice running games; don’t try to do both 
- Can consider doing GM recruitment earlier than OGLs and keeping it open for a longer duration (generally more people want to be OGLs instead)
- Make manpower allocation plans in advance so you can communicate info to GMs (When people feel more involved they’re usually more invested) (can ask Welfare to help out with this)
- GMs need to be aware of the hard NOs when it comes to game rules etc. but generally they can be quite flexible and change things up for safety reasons/so people have more fun etc.
- Make sure GMs are CLEAR and AWARE of your rules, points system, and the timetable (this is where having a section IC 
- GMs generally tend to be less extroverted/”onz” compared to OGLs 
- GMs cannot control 20+ 40+ people on their own, OGLs need to help out as well in terms of getting the OGMs to listen, briefing on rules, etc. (coordinate with Welfare/talk to OGLs yourself to make this clear)
- Where possible I assigned more than 1 GM but ideally they can hold their own, if really not enough manpower after pulling from seniors + other comms + everyone and anyone you know can consider letting OGLs direct some games for their OGs
- There may be conflict between GMs and OGLs, personally I thought it was good that GMs were under Progs and OGLs under Welfare because then any GM-OGL conflict comes down to a discussion between Ocomm directors + each side feels equally represented but maybe its not that deep 🤷
### OGLs
OGLs help set the tone for Ori, keep the hype up, and get their OGs where they need to be when they need to be. 
- OGL Bonding Day: For the OGLs to get to know one another, and for Welfare to assess the OGLs outside of interview
- Dry Run: Should be to trial run games you’re not sure about, dry run the schedule for actual Ori, practice movements and meal times etc. this is a critical opportunity to make sure OGLs are clear on what they’re supposed to do 
- Refresher: Last chance to refresh everyone’s memories before actual Ori
- OGLs are the next best source of feedback after GMs
- I found it difficult to balance between getting the OGLs to take things seriously (for the sake of being on time and things running smoothly) and encouraging them to have fun (bc that’s the whole point of Ori) but while it’s good for OGLs to also be having fun, the main objective is for their OGMs to have fun. Enlist Welfare and PDs to help with managing OGLs.
### OSL
OSL are trying to help you and they will try to get you whatever you need 
- However, don’t be afraid to question anything they say, ask for deadline extensions, tell them something can’t be done or defend why you want to do something
- OSL are generally nice and try to be helpful but they are also under more restrictions because they work directly for the school. Crystal has the most experience but Peggy helped out quite a bit with the proposals and Charlene helped out for Finale (Peggy only helped out for our year; Charlene only joined halfway through)
### Others
- For all comms, GMs, OGLs: keep key Ori dates free, ESPECIALLY ORI ITSELF. Make it clear to everyone involved in Ori who needs to be there that they MUST show up, any internships jobs whatever START IT AFTER this is crucial for d-day because (for us) it was after our holidays had already started. Get everyone to put it in their calendars, set monthly Tele reminders, anything.
- Finale:
  - Contact Bands (& other 5th rows) early
  - Bands mostly handled Finale stuff like set up etc bands does all the av they know what they’re doing
  - I had a few members of Programmes comm doing Finale stuff (I mostly didn’t ask them to help out for other Programmes stuff other than being GM, I don’t think this was a good way to do it): the finale subcomm did the proposal for finale (what to buy, layout, 5th rows involved + setlists) and the decor on the day itself
  - Think about prizes: which prizes are presented during closing ceremony (usually by GOHs/VIPs, so need to be big and presentable enough) and which are during Finale?)
